Gradle lifecycle
- Initialization: Gradle supports single and multi-project builds. During the initialization phase, Gradle determines which projects are going to take part in the build, and creates a Project instance for each of these projects.
- Configuration: During this phase the project objects are configured. The build scripts of all projects which are part of the build are executed. 
- Execution: Based on the task name arguments passed, Gradle determines the subset of the tasks. Gradle then executes each of the selected tasks.
