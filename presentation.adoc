== The power of ant

* Easy to customize
* Many community plugins
* Good vendor support

== The problems of ant

* Not DRY
** Tasks have few defaults
** Task dependencies are always explicit
** No default tasks
** Which version of ant?
* Dependency management
* IDE integration lacking (classpath)
* XML as code !!

== The power of Maven

* DRY
* Consistent defaults
* Goals dependencies built in
* Dependency management
* IDE integration good
* Many community plugins
* Good vendor support

== The problems of Maven

* Learning curve
* Goal discovery
* Hard to customize
** Goal dependencies built in
** The Maven Wayâ„¢
* More XML !!

== Gradle to the Rescue

== Projects and tasks

* Tasks dependencies

== DEMO: Simple tasks

* Using Ant tasks
* Dynamic tasks
* Marker tasks (like ant targets)

== The DRY of maven, aka convention over configuration
* Copy a file conditionally
* 2 jars from one project (Android)
* Generated source code

== Java plugin

== War plugin

== Dependency management

* ivy
* maven
* directory

== Gradle lifecycle
== Initialization
Gradle supports single and multi-project builds. During the
initialization phase, Gradle determines which projects are going to take
part in the build, and creates a Project instance for each of these
projects.

== Configuration

During this phase the project objects are configured. The build scripts
of all projects which are part of the build are executed.

== Execution

Based on the task name arguments passed, Gradle determines the subset of
the tasks. Gradle then executes each of the selected tasks.

== Customizing

== Settings file

== Init scripts

== Lifecycle listening

== Multi-project builds
